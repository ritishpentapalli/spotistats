# spotistats 

## Setup 

### Installing dependencies

spotistats primarily runs on Python. Make sure you have all dependencies installed before running it.
<br>
Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required dependencies, either in a virtual environment or globally.

### How to run it locally

Once all dependencies are installed, run `app.py`. This starts up our local server.
<br>
To access the server, open `http://127.0.0.1:3000` or `http://localhost:3000/` in any web browser on the device
